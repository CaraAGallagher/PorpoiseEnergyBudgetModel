# PEB_Model

Simulating the energetics and population dynamics of harbor porpoises in the inner Danish waters.

The model was developed as part of the DEPONS project (Disturbance Effects of POrpoises in the North Sea) at Aarhus University, Denmark. The code was developed in NetLogo and must be used in this software. Please install the code from the zip-file to ensure that all the necessary input files are available and located in the right directories. This model builds on a previous model of porpoise movements which can be found at https://github.com/jacobnabe/PorpoiseModel.
